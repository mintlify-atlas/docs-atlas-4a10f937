---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your macOS machine:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Xcode" icon="apple">
    Xcode 12.0 or later with iOS 14.0+ SDK
  </Card>
  <Card title="CocoaPods" icon="box">
    Dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C projects
  </Card>
  <Card title="Git" icon="code-branch">
    Version control for cloning the repository
  </Card>
  <Card title="Firebase Account" icon="fire">
    Free Firebase account for backend services
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  This app requires **iOS 14.0 or later** as the deployment target. Make sure your development device or simulator is running a compatible version.
</Note>

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the TikTok Clone repository to your local machine:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Terminal">
    Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project:
    
    ```bash
    cd ~/Developer
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    Clone the project from GitHub:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dks333/Tiktok-Clone.git
    cd Tiktok-Clone/KD\ Tiktok-Clone
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify project structure">
    Check that all files are present:
    
    ```bash
    ls -la
    ```
    
    You should see:
    - `Podfile` - CocoaPods dependency file
    - `KD Tiktok-Clone.xcodeproj` - Xcode project
    - `KD Tiktok-Clone/` - Source code directory
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Install CocoaPods

CocoaPods is required to manage third-party dependencies. If you don't have it installed:

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

<Note>
  You may need to enter your macOS password when using `sudo`.
</Note>

Verify the installation:

```bash
pod --version
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

The project uses several third-party libraries managed by CocoaPods:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to project directory">
    Make sure you're in the directory containing the `Podfile`:
    
    ```bash
    cd "KD Tiktok-Clone"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install pods">
    Run CocoaPods to install all dependencies:
    
    ```bash
    pod install
    ```
    
    This will install:
    - **SnapKit** - DSL for Auto Layout
    - **RxSwift** - Reactive programming framework
    - **MarqueeLabel** - Scrolling text labels
    - **Lottie** - Animation library
    - **Firebase/Analytics** - User analytics
    - **Firebase/Storage** - Video storage
    - **Firebase/Firestore** - NoSQL database
    
    <Note>
      The first pod install may take several minutes as it downloads all dependencies.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify installation">
    After installation completes, you should see:
    
    ```
    Pod installation complete! There are X dependencies from the Podfile.
    ```
    
    You'll also notice a new file: `KD Tiktok-Clone.xcworkspace`
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Podfile Configuration

Here's what the `Podfile` looks like:

```ruby Podfile
target 'KD Tiktok-Clone' do
  use_frameworks!
  inhibit_all_warnings!

  # Pods for KD Tiktok-Clone
  pod 'SnapKit'
  pod 'RxSwift', '~> 5'
  pod 'MarqueeLabel'
  pod 'lottie-ios'
  
  # Database
  pod 'Firebase/Analytics'
  pod 'Firebase/Storage'
  pod 'Firebase/Firestore'
end
```

<Warning>
  **Always open the `.xcworkspace` file, NOT the `.xcodeproj` file** after running `pod install`. The workspace contains both your project and the Pods project.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Open the Project in Xcode

Now that dependencies are installed, open the project:

```bash
open "KD Tiktok-Clone.xcworkspace"
```

Alternatively, you can:
1. Launch Xcode
2. Select **File → Open**
3. Navigate to `KD Tiktok-Clone.xcworkspace` and open it

## Step 5: Configure Xcode Project Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the project">
    In Xcode's Project Navigator (left sidebar), click on the top-level **KD Tiktok-Clone** project file.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update Bundle Identifier">
    1. Select the **KD Tiktok-Clone** target
    2. Go to the **Signing & Capabilities** tab
    3. Change the **Bundle Identifier** to something unique:
    
    ```
    com.yourname.tiktok-clone
    ```
    
    <Note>
      This must be unique and match the bundle ID you'll configure in Firebase later.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Team & Signing">
    1. Under **Team**, select your Apple Developer account
    2. Check **Automatically manage signing**
    3. Xcode will automatically generate provisioning profiles
    
    <Warning>
      You need a (free) Apple Developer account to run the app on a physical device. Simulator testing doesn't require this.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set deployment target">
    1. Go to the **General** tab
    2. Under **Deployment Info**, ensure:
       - **iOS** is set to **14.0** or later
       - **iPhone** is selected as the device type
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 6: Add Firebase Configuration

Before building, you need to add your Firebase configuration file:

<Warning>
  The app **will not compile** without a valid `GoogleService-Info.plist` file. Follow the [Firebase Setup](/firebase-setup) guide first.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download GoogleService-Info.plist">
    From your Firebase Console, download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add to Xcode project">
    1. In Xcode, right-click the **KD Tiktok-Clone** folder
    2. Select **Add Files to "KD Tiktok-Clone"...**
    3. Choose your `GoogleService-Info.plist` file
    4. Make sure **"Copy items if needed"** is checked
    5. Click **Add**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify placement">
    The file should be in the **Utils/** folder:
    
    ```
    KD Tiktok-Clone/
    └── Utils/
        └── GoogleService-Info.plist
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 7: Build and Run

You're ready to build the app!

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a simulator or device">
    At the top of Xcode, click the device selector and choose:
    - **iPhone 14 Pro** (simulator) for testing
    - Your physical iPhone if connected
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Build the project">
    Press **⌘ + B** or select **Product → Build**
    
    The build process will:
    1. Compile Swift source files
    2. Link frameworks and dependencies
    3. Process storyboards and assets
    4. Generate the app binary
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run the app">
    Press **⌘ + R** or click the **Run** button (▶️)
    
    The app will launch in the simulator or on your device.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Firebase Initialization

When the app launches, Firebase is automatically configured in `AppDelegate.swift`:

```swift AppDelegate.swift:17-21
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    // Override point for customization after application launch.
    FirebaseApp.configure()
    return true
}
```

## Troubleshooting

# Clean pods
rm -rf Pods/
rm Podfile.lock

# Reinstall
pod install
```

Then in Xcode:
1. **Product → Clean Build Folder** (⌘ + Shift + K)
2. **Product → Build** (⌘ + B)

<Note>
